Access Cirrus
=============

Information on how to get access to Cirrus. How you get access depends on 
if you are working in industry or academia and how much resource you require.

Resource Units
--------------

Access to Cirrus is currently granted in units of:

* Core-h for compute allocations: 1 Cirrus Core-h is the equivalent of 1 physical core used for 1 hour;
* GiB for disk allocations: 1 GiB is 1048576 kB.

Industry Access
---------------

Cirrus has been designed to support a wide range of industry applications 
and EPCC can provide both access to HPC resources and also consultancy to
effectively exploit HPC resources.

For access to Cirrus and EPCC expertise please contact Thomas Blyth
(<t.blyth@epcc.ed.ac.uk>, +44 131 651 3460) and see the 
[EPCC Accelerator](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/work-us/industry-engagement-programmes/accelerator)
page.

Academic Access
---------------

Cirrus is one of the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk) Tier-2 National HPC facilities and
so the access method for academic researchers is different depending on if your 
research falls within EPSRC remit or not.

### EPSRC Access

If your research falls under the EPSRC remit then you can use a number of
different access routes (please follow the links for further information):

* [Instant Access](instant.html): small amounts of time and storage space to explore use of Cirrus for your research
* [Grant Access](grant.html): Larger amounts of time and storage for lifetime of research grant
* [Access to HPC](access-to-hpc.html): Provides an open and relatively flexible route to computational support.

In all cases, you should complete a Cirrus Technical Assessment form. This short form allows our technical experts to ensure that your project will get the most out of access to Cirrus and will help us to make sure that Cirrus can support the research you wish to undertake.  

### Access for academics at Scottish institutions

If you are working at a Scottish institution you can get access to Cirrus for your research - either on a trial basis
to test the service for your research or on a larger scale for the use of Cirrus in a research programme. There is
no restriction on research area remit for Scottish academic access. For both trial and larger access, applicants
should use the the same Scottish technical assessment form. For more information see the 
[Scottish Academic Access page](scottish.html).

**Note:** If you working at a Scottish institution and wish to include Cirrus access on a Grant proposal, you
should use the [Grant Access process](grant.html) rather than the Scottish Academic Access route.

### Other grant awarding bodies and researchers outside the UK

* [Instant Access](instant.html): small amounts of time and storage space to explore use of Cirrus for your research
* [Grant Access](grant.html): Larger amounts of time and storage for lifetime of 
research grant

Please contact the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/) in the first instance to discuss 
access to Cirrus.
