## Current System Load

The plot below shows the status of the CPU nodes on the current Cirrus service for the past day
(note: the Cirrus GPU nodes are not included in this plot).

A description of each of the status types is provided below the plot.

- *alloc*: Nodes running user jobs
- *idle*: Nodes available for user jobs
- *resv*: Nodes in reservation and not available for standard user jobs
- *down*, *drain*, *maint*, *drng*, *comp*: Nodes unavailable for user jobs
- *mix*: Nodes in multiple states 

Note: the long running reservation visible in the plot corresponds to the *short* QoS which
is used to support small, short jobs with fast turnaround time.

## At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
