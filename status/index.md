## Thursday 17th March 1530: Return to Service

The upgraded Cirrus service has now been returned to service.
There are a reduced number of nodes available 220/280 CPU nodes while HPE continue to investigate an issue. We hope to return all nodes to service by next week.

Please contact support@cirrus.ac.uk if you have any questions or require assistance and apologies for any inconvenience caused by the delay to return to service.

## Wednesday 16th March: Cirrus Upgrade Status and Delayed Return to Service

The HPE and EPCC Systems team continue to make good progress and are continuing to investigate some ongoing issues with the upgrade but a lot of issues have been resolved. The CSE team have completed their testing and the final documentation updates are being made. 
We will provide a further update tomorrow and apologise for the delay in return to service.  


## Friday 11th March: 

Unfortunately, there was a delayed start to the upgrade process due to hardware issues on Cirrus. The hardware issues have been resolved and the teams have been making good progress with the Cirrus upgrade. The cluster management software has been upgraded and the operating system on the login and compute nodes has also been upgraded. The EPCC systems team are now making our local customisations to Cirrus in parallel to final work by HPE. The Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) team are also testing the programming environment and will rebuild any application software where needed.

The new CEPH storage is now attached to Cirrus and further details of the new storage arrangements will be sent via a user mailing and will be fully documented on the Cirrus website.

Given the delayed start to the upgrade process, we are not able to reopen the service on Monday 14th March as previously advertised. We will send a further user mailing on Wednesday 16th March where we hope to confirm the return to service time and do apologise for the delay in return to service.

## Cirrus Upgrade: Monday 21st February - Monday 14th March 
 
The Cirrus Service will be upgraded from Monday 21st February - Monday 14th March but users will be notified if we are able to return the system earlier. During this time, the Cirrus Service will be unavailable. This means that users will not be able to connect to the Cirrus login nodes, run jobs or access any data stored on Cirrus. Any jobs that are in the batch system queue will be removed.

There will be new storage arrangements when the system is returned to users and these will be detailed in further user messages before the system is returned alongside updated documentation.


## Current System Load

The plot below shows the status of the CPU nodes on the current Cirrus service for the past day
(note: the Cirrus GPU nodes are not included in this plot).

A description of each of the status types is provided below the plot.

title="Cirrus Node Status over time"}

- *alloc*: Nodes running user jobs
- *idle*: Nodes available for user jobs
- *resv*: Nodes in reservation and not available for standard user jobs
- *down*, *drain*, *maint*, *drng*, *comp*: Nodes unavailable for user jobs
- *mix*: Nodes in multiple states 

Note: the long running reservation visible in the plot corresponds to the *short* QoS which
is used to support small, short jobs with fast turnaround time.


## Known Issues 

We are experiening a heavy load on the metadata server. Our systems team are investigating but we suspect this is due to user(s) performing many I/O operations. We apologise for the inconvenience this is causing users.

## At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
